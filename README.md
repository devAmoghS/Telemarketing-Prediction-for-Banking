This is an independent Jupyter notebook where we want to predict **whether a customer will buy a term loan or not**

# Tasks
1. Reducing the costs of the marketing teams incurred during campaigns
2. Improving the success rate of the converting the prospect to customer

# Gains Chart and Lorenz Curve

### If we were to target the top 3 deciles {10, 9, 8} then we would captured 71% compared to 30% in a no model scenario

### We can also design audience profiles and perform prioritze targeting to improve overall perfomance when compared to random selection of audience
